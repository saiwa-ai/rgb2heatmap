        Generates and overlays a Gaussian-based heatmap on the input image for each bounding box.

        For each bounding box:
            1. A central region is extracted based on the `area_ratio`.
            2. A random pixel is selected from this central region to serve as the Gaussian center.
            3. A 2D Gaussian heatmap is generated with spread determined by `sigma_ratio` and 
            the bounding box size.
            4. The heatmap is accumulated into the final result using a pixel-wise maximum to 
            handle overlapping bounding boxes.
            5. The final heatmap is normalized and visualized as an overlay on the input image.

        Args:
            image (np.ndarray): Input image on which the heatmap will be overlaid.
            bboxes (np.ndarray): Array of bounding boxes, each defined as (x, y, width, height).
            area_ratio (float, optional): Fraction of the bounding box area used to define 
                the central region for random point selection. Default is 0.1 (i.e., 10% area).
            sigma_ratio (float, optional): Ratio used to compute the standard deviation 
                of the Gaussian relative to the bounding box size. Default is 0.333.
